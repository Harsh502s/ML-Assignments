LASSO regression) Or to minimize the sum of the squares of the coefficients — we call this method L2 regularization (a.k.a. Ridge regression) And because of this tiny difference, these 2 methods will end up behaving very differently."

    "\n",
    "#### The biggest difference between L1 and L2 regularization is that L1 will shrink some coefficients to exactly zero (practically excluding them from the model), making it behave as a variable selection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In contrast, because L2 minimizes the sum of the squares of the coefficients, it will affect larger ones much more than it will shrink smaller ones, so coefficients close to zero will barely be shrunk further. Therefore, with L2 regularization, we end up with a model that has a lot of coefficients close to, but not exactly zero."

It will also perform better (have a higher prediction accuracy) than ridge regression in situations where a small number of independent variables are good predictors of the outcome and the rest are not that important.\n",
